dans is the innovative data platform that powers the Kulina UIs. dans allows you to model all your backend data as a single Virtual JSON object on your Node server. On the client you work with your remote JSON object using familiar JavaScript operations like get, set, and call. If you know your data, you know your API.

dans is middleware. It is not a replacement for your application server, database, or MVC framework. Instead dans can be used to optimize communication between the layers of a new or existing application.
